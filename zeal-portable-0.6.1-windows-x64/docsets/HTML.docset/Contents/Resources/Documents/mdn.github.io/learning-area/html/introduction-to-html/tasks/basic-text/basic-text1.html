      Basic HTML Animals

      This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.

      The Llama

      Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.

      The Anaconda

      The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
